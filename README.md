Sidewards-Space-Game
===

This poorly named project is from high school when I did a VET course at the Academy of Interactive Entertainment in Game Development Foundation. 

In this project I was expected to make a basic game, but I wanted to experiment with GUI, simple AI and for a bit of fun, time manipulation via the time-slow mechanic. 
I'm pretty happy with the result and what I learned despite its simplicity.
